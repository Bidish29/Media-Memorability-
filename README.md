# Media Memorability
Predicting Media Memorability using various Machine Learning models and features.

Memorability of videos plays an important role in todayâ€™s world where millions of videos are generated on a daily  basis. The MediaEval media memorability[1] task aims at predicting the memorability of videos using various machine learning models. The machine learning models are trained on various features and the results are then tabulated. The best combination of the model and the feature is then selected to predict the short-term and long-term memorability scores.
